# Simple-Django-Demo-with-D3-Visualization

A simple Django demo with D3 visualization. 

    The dataset is uploaded in "http://127.0.0.1:8000/data/", while the homepage "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" uses AJAX to read the dataset 
from the url of the dataset and achieve visualization using Force-Directed Graph.

    Press "update" button and the graph can be updated with new dataset from the server.
